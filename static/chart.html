<h1>Language Visualization</h1>
<h2>This project helps analyze text quickly by organizing sentences into topic groups automatically. Paste in any English (only, for now) text, select the number clusters, then click "Send Text to Server."</h2>
<p>I love NLP and I built this in a weekend. I wanted to share it because I just found myself using it to analyze a text that looked too long/intimidating that I wanted to understand faster than I could read it.</p>
I think my text has <input id="num_clusters" type="number" min="2" max="20" increment="1" value="3"> groups. <br />
<button onclick="fetchAndDraw()">Send Text to Server</button><br />
<button onclick="getMeNewColours()">Get Me New Random Colours!</button><br />
<textarea id="user_text" columns="100" rows="5">paste your text here</textarea><br />
<div id="coloured_text">
  Clustered Text will appear here.
</div>
<div id="cluster_controls">
  Clusters Data will appear here.
