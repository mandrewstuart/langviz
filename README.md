I'm going to publish a book called How To Waste Time With Python and Natural Langauge Processing

Input:
A text with multiple sentences and an expected number of topics/clusters.

Output:
A (custom made, using HTML5's canvas) scatterplot of those sentences, colour-coded by KMeans cluster.
Also, radio buttons with the ability to filter out the scatterplot to that cluster and click to see the associated sentence.
The radio buttons also highlight that cluster's sentences in the text.
